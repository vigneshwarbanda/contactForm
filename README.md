# Contact Form with JavaScript Validation

## Project Overview
This project is part of **Task 6** from my Web Development Internship.  
The goal is to create a **Contact Form** with **client-side validation** using JavaScript, ensuring that:
- **Name** is not empty.
- **Email** follows a valid format (checked using **Regex**).
- **Message** is not empty.

On valid submission, a success message is displayed; otherwise, error messages are shown dynamically below the input fields.
